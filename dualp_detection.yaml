# Dual-Purkinje Eye Tracker Dataset Configuration
# For YOLO object detection training

# Dataset root path (relative to this file)
path: yolo_dualp

# Training and validation image paths (relative to 'path')
train: images/train
val: images/train  # Using same for now - split manually if needed

# Number of classes
nc: 3

# Class names (order matters - matches class IDs in labels)
names:
  0: pupil_mask        # Large pupil region (may be partially occluded)
  1: purkinje1_mask    # First Purkinje reflection (usually visible)
  2: purkinje4_mask    # Fourth Purkinje reflection (often missing)

# Additional metadata
description: "Dual-Purkinje eye tracking dataset with separate object classes"
authors: ["Eye Tracking Lab"]
version: "1.0"

# Training notes:
# - Images may contain 1-3 objects depending on visibility
# - Missing P4 reflections are handled gracefully
# - Designed for fast inference (~1-2ms) with post-processing for precision
# - Consider creating validation split: 80% train, 20% val
